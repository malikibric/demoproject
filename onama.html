<h2>🗺️ About us</h2>

<section class="about-text">
   <p>
    We are a conceptual solution to make finding real estate easier in the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina – Sarajevo. 
    We believe the process of searching for an apartment or house doesn’t have to be complicated and frustrating.
    Our goal is to offer an interactive map with the latest market listings, whether you are buying or renting. 
    <br><br>
    We believe that transparency, simplicity, and quick access to information can ease decision-making and save valuable time. 
    Through this project, we aim to contribute to the digitalization of the real estate market and provide users with a modern tool that truly helps.
